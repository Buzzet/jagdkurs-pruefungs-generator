# PLAN

## Scope
Build a public Nuxt-based exam generator for Jagdkurs, powered by local JSON datasets.

## Milestones
1. Setup Nuxt app + base pages
2. Define JSON schema for questions
3. Implement generator logic (difficulty/categories/mix)
4. Add result view + scoring
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages from `main`
6. Add post-deploy WhatsApp notification hook

## Risks
- Static hosting constraints on GitHub Pages
- JSON quality/consistency impacts output quality
